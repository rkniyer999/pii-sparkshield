PII Detection and Anonymization with PySpark
In the era of data democratization and AI-driven insights, protecting personally identifiable information (PII) is no longer just a regulatory checkbox——it’s a foundational pillar of responsible data engineering and AI development.

# Data Anonymization
Data anonymization is the process of transforming personal or sensitive data in such a way that the individuals to whom the data pertains can no longer be identified—either directly or indirectly. This is a critical step in ensuring compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR, PDPA, and HIPAA, and in enabling safe data sharing for analytics and AI model training.

This repo explores how to build scalable, secure, and compliant data workflows using PySpark, Microsoft Presidio, and Faker—covering hands-on examples of detection, masking, hashing, and synthetic data generation that apply equally to data engineering and AI use cases.
